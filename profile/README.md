## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can find out more about Trek View here: https://www.trekview.org/

I write lots of blogs on the subject of 360 photography with a focus on the technical side of the subject. Find them here: https://www.trekview.org/blog/

All our work is open-source and available under permissive licenses here on GitHub (Apache 2.0). Hopefully you will find some of it useful for your own projects.

Currently most of my work is focused on GoPro Fusion and MAX cameras, but many of the concepts are transferable to other 360 cameras.

Thanks for stopping by!
