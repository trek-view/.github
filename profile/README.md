## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You can find out more about Trek View here: https://www.trekview.org/about/

I (David) write lots of blogs on the subject of 360 photography with a focus on the technical side of the subject. Find them here: https://www.trekview.org/blog/

All our work is open-source and available under permissive licenses here on GitHub. Hopefully you will find some of it useful for your own projects.

I am currently working on software to allow anyone with an action camera to help build an open 3D map of the natural world scheduled for release in Q3 2022.

Thanks for stopping by. If you would like to join our small community, or have a question about Trek View, please join us on Discord: https://discord.gg/ZVk7h9hCfw
